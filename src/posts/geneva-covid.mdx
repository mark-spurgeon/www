Right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, I set out to map the places
where physical distancing is next to impossible.

As people were left with more time on their hand and were forced 
to **queue outside** to do their shopping, the need for more public 
space became clear.

This map highlights the streets that lack public space (or **queuing spaces**) compared 
to the estimated number of shoppers. It also proposes to 
**pedestrianize certain streets** for people to move around safely.


### Geneva's most crowded streets during the corona pandemic

### Queuing spaces

It is impossible to know the exact numbers of shoppers per shop, especially
as these are exceptional times and not all shops are opened, but some shops 
are more successful than others. 

Hence, I have estimated the number of customers based on observations, or rather
the number of people queuing outside during rush hours (noting that 
they still exist despite the change). 

| Shop | Queuing places | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| Very Big Supermarket | 35 | Rare but creates crowds |
| Big Supermarket & 'Department Store' | 30 | The most frequent |
| Small Supermarket | 15 | Second most frequent |
| Convenience Stores | 10 | Alternative to supermarket |
| Bakeries, Restaurants, ... | 4 | Varies a lot... | 


### Free space

Free space is the space that allows people to move and stand around safely. 
It excludes the space dedicated to cars. Even though fewer cars are
around, pedestrians tend not to use that space. 

The next step was to calculate the number of queuing places outside. A grid of
points seperated by a **2m distance** has been created to simulate the recommended 
distance. Though the configuration may allow for more people to queue on a given 
space, it represents a detailed enough representation of how many queuing spaces 
are available.
