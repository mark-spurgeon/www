This is a project I made while studying arts in the equivalent of high school
in Switzerland. It's a short film made in november **2015**.

I way inspired by graffiti, photography and comics. Of course, I was also 
a keen 3D animator, and I wanted to make an animation that way artistic more
than photorealistic or disney-like (animation often falls into one category
or the other).

Looking back at it, I see every single little thing I could've changed, but 
I keep a really fond memory of making it. The experience of editing the footage,
blending reality and computer generated images, to make a moving picture with some
rhythm (although clearly amateurish) was quite great.
