As a keen web designer and GIS cartographer, I get to work with graphic design quite a lot.

This is a personal guide to dealing with font pairings, whitespace, and general
web design-related good practises. This won't focus on more creative things like 
content, composition, colours and so on. Rather, this is a set 
of rules and theories that are meant to create good designs faster.
