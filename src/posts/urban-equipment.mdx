I'm interested in the different types of urban equipment, their cost
and why they're useful in our cities. Do they encourage people to spend
more time outside, in the urban space ? Do we need more and *can* we have 
more ? Are people willing to invest in urban equipment ? Are better ways
to cater these equipment to individuals through the use of technology ?

In my hometown of Geneva, most urban equipment consists of benches that have
been fixed in place permanently. They are made of steel and wood, they've been
built to suffer all weathers and last decades. Unsuprisingly, the price of 
these is quite steep. The cheapest item, a small 1.80m bench, costs a minimum of 
800chf whereas the most common bench costs 1480chf.
